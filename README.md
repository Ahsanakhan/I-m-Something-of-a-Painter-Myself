I'm Something of a Painter Myself
This project is part of the "Introduction to Deep Learning" course final assignment. It involves participating in the Kaggle competition "I'm Something of a Painter Myself" to generate Monet-style images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

Project Description
The main objective is to create a GAN model that can generate high-quality images in the style of Claude Monet's paintings. The project includes the following steps:

Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset, which consists of Monet paintings and photographs.
GAN Development: Create a GAN model with a generator and a discriminator.
Model Training: Train the GAN using the dataset to capture Monet's distinctive style.
Image Generation: Generate new images in Monet's style using the trained generator.
Evaluation: Evaluate the generated images using the MiFID score.
Submission: Package the generated images for submission to the Kaggle competition.
